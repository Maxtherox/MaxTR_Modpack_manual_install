Hello, welcome to the MaxTR's Modpack installation manual.

<------------------>

Please note that this manual is still under development and does not have any design yet. Its function is solely to help you with the installation. Soon there will be a version with a design and more beautiful manual (as well as videos on the channel).

<------------------>

> Before downloading, you will need 3 tools:

- Mod organizer 2: [Mod Organizer 2 at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194)
- Loot: [https://loot.github.io/](https://loot.github.io/)
- 7zip: https://www.7-zip.org/download.html (it is mandatory to use 7zip for extraction)

<------------------>

> You must have at least 200GB free and it should be extracted to the root of your HD/SSD Example:"C:Maxtrmodpack" make sure the folder has all the permissions of Windows.

1. Download my Skyrim folder (Mandatory)
  

- 5 Files .7z Total: 10.5GB
  
  - name: Skyrim Special Edition.7z

2. Download my mandatory mods folder.
  

- 25 Files .7z Total: 48.7GB
  
  - name: SkyrimSEMaxTR2023ultra.7z

3. After downloading, extract the Skyrim folder to a separate folder (Remember, it must be done in the root directory of your computer, and the folder should not contain any special characters or spaces). To extract, simply use 7z as the extraction method on the first file, and all the others will be extracted automatically.
  
4. Once you have extracted the folders separately, install Mod Organizer 2 and create a portable instance. When Mod Organizer asks about your Skyrim (do not click on the Skyrim icon), click on Browse and then go to the path where you extracted my Skyrim folder. Example: "C:Maxtrmodpack\Skyrim Special Edition"
  
5. In the next question from Mod Organizer, it will ask you to create an instance. Select browse again and go to the path where you extracted the 25 modpack files. Example: "C:Maxtrmodpack\SkyrimSEMaxTR2023ultra"
  
6. Click next, and you will receive an error that the "default" profile is not configured. Do not worry, I deleted the default profile on purpose, and this will not affect your gameplay. Once it is done, it will ask if you want to see a tutorial on how to use Mod Organizer. Click on "No."
  
7. With Mod Organizer open, next to "Run," click on SKSE. Some tabs will appear, click on the Edit tab and select the loot you downloaded/installed and press OK.
  
8. Click on edit again and go to my Skyrim folder, select the folder "Skyrim Special Edition\data\Nemesis_Engine\Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine.exe" select the .exe and press OK.
  
9. Disable your antivirus and through Mod Organizer select Nemesis and click on run. With Nemesis selected, click on "update engine," and after updating the engine, click on "launch nemesis." Once finished, make sure you have 1044 animations. If you have less than that, your installation may be incorrect.
  
10. Open Loot through Mod Organizer and make sure all the plugins are showing there. If it is showing any plugins from the creative kit or if it is empty, it means your Loot is configured for your old Skyrim. You can easily configure the correct directory for my Skyrim folder by going to "File" in the top right corner of Loot, then "Settings." In settings, select "TES V: Skyrim special edition," and in "Install path," select the "Install path": select the root folder of my Skyrim.

11. After that, make sure you've configured your game's resolution in the skyrimPrefs.ini file. You can easily do this through the Mod Organizer by clicking on the puzzle symbol with a red piece, selecting "ini editor," going to the second tab "skyrimPrefs.ini," pressing "Ctrl + F," and searching for "iSize H" (this is the vertical size of the image) and "iSize W" (this is the horizontal size of your image). For common full HD resolutions, use:
iSize H=1080
iSize W=1920

12. Your Skyrim is now perfectly configured, and you can enjoy playing! Remember to always open it through SKSE while in Mod Organizer, and also remember to create a new game every time you use the Loot tool to install new mods and Nemesis to install animation mods.

# Extra

For English-speaking users, in the Mod Organizer, disable any mods with the acronyms "PT-BR," "ptbr," "portugues," "brasil," "Brazilian," "traducao," or "Portuguese." These are language translation mods for Portuguese, and you can disable them to return the game to English. (use the Mod Organizer's filter to search for keywords)
